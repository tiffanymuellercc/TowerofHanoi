## About The Project
This project solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using both recursive and iterative approaches in C#. It visualizes each disk move across three rods, displaying the solutions for different numbers of disks.

### Built With:
- C#: Programming language used for logic implementation.
- Visual Studio: Development environment.
- .NET Framework: For building and running the application.


## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE for C#.
- .NET Framework installed on your system.

### Installation
- git clone (where: https://github.com/tiffanymuellercc/TowerofHanoi)
- dotnet build
- dotnet run -Iterative 4
- dotnet run -Recursive 4
  - or any # above 0

### Usage
- Run the program by specifying the number of disks (example: 3) for either Iterative or Recursive.
- The program will show the Tower of Hanoi puzzle's solution

## Roadmap 
- Recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi.
- Iterative solution for Tower of Hanoi using bitwise operations.
- Visualization of each move using the DrawHanoiTowers function.
